Fall 2022

Code was written in Scala in the IntelliJ IDE.

To run, run the file named SelfCheckoutGUI in /src/store/view/SelfCheckoutGUI.

In the GUI, the item codes '472' and '8' add two different items to the checkout cart. From there, pressing 'Loyalty Card' will apply a sale to the '472' item and 'Checkout' can be pressed to finish the transaction.

This project had the extra challenge of not being allowed to use any conditional statements to demonstrate the use of state pattern.
